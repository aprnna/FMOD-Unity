# FMOD Audio System

This is a sample project to show a simple integration of FMOD and Unity.

The *audio-system-fmod-project* directory is the FMOD project.

The *audio-system-unity-project* is the Unity project.

The branches of this repo follow the implementation for the video series. Each branch represents the state of the system for a given video. The videos can be found on the below YouTube channel.

Please feel free to take the system from this example and use it however you'd like with the exception of the audio files as explained in the below section.

## Audio Files

Audio files used in this FMOD project are all from FMOD's example project with an exception for the 'Coin Collected' and 'Coin Idle' sounds which I made myself. 

The Audio files in this project should be only be used for non-commercial or educational purposes.
